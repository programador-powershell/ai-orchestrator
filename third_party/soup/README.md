Soup turns the pain of LLM fine-tuning into a simple workflow. One config, one command, done.

```bash
pip install "soup-cli[train]"   # add [train] to fine-tune; bare `soup-cli` is the light CLI
soup init --template chat
soup train
```

**Fine-tune an 8B model on a 4 GB laptop GPU.** Layer streaming keeps the frozen base out of
VRAM and feeds it to the GPU one decoder layer at a time. Measured on an RTX 3050 Laptop 4 GB:
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct + NF4 at **119.6 tok/s, 3.32 GB peak** — bit-exact against a normal
resident run, and reproduced independently on an H100 at 113.00 tok/s in the same 3.32 GB.
(The tok/s figure was measured on v0.72.2, before the v0.73.0 correctness repair that cost
−4.8% at 32B; it has not been re-run on a 4 GB card since.) Opt-in (`stream_layers: true`)
and still BETA —

## Why Soup?

Training LLMs is still painful. Even experienced teams spend 30-50% of their time fighting
infrastructure instead of improving models. Soup fixes that.

- **Zero SSH.** Never SSH into a broken GPU box again.
- **One config.** A simple YAML file is all you need.
- **Auto everything.** Batch size, GPU detection, quantization — handled.
- **Works locally.** Train on your own GPU with QLoRA. No cloud required.

## What's New

**v0.73.0 — three days on somebody else's hardware.** Every number Soup had ever published
came from one machine: a 4 GB RTX 3050 laptop running Windows. From 5–9 August it ran on a
borrowed 8×H100 box. That found real bugs, and it confirmed the headline claim on hardware
nothing like the one it was made on.

- **The laptop result reproduces elsewhere.** Llama-3.1-8B NF4 streamed: 119.6 tok/s in a
  3.32 GB peak on the RTX 3050, against a **median 113.00 tok/s in the same 3.32 GB** on an
  H100. Layer streaming is bound by host-to-device transfer, not by the GPU.
- **A silent wrong-gradient bug, found and fixed.** On NF4 models above ~165 MiB per layer
  (32B and up), `bitsandbytes` kept a weight reference where gradient checkpointing could
  not see it, so the forward stayed exact and the loss curve looked healthy while the
  *gradients* were wrong. Repaired and gated on real 32B (**256/256 gradient tensors exact**
  against a control's 8–12/256) and real 72B (**320/320** against 8/320), at −4.8% and
  −3.7% throughput.
- **Four backends that had never actually run, now do.** `soup train --gpus N` handed
  `accelerate` the Python binary and every rank died parsing it as source. DeepSpeed could
  not train a LoRA model on any stage. SGLang returned 500 on 100% of generations. And
  `use_fsdp2_compile` wrote adapters that reload as **all zeros** (0 of 96 tensors live).
- **The vLLM backend now uses your model's chat template**, instead of a hand-rolled
  `"User:/Assistant:"` string it was never trained on. Same server, same sampling: a run-on
  loop burning 200 tokens before, an 8-token answer after.
- **New: `training.seed`** (every run was hardcoded to 42) and **full fine-tuning via
  `lora.r: 0`** (the code path existed but was unreachable).
- **A streamed model is as good as a resident one** — paired over five training subsets and
  judged by Soup's own `soup ship`: mean difference **+0.006** against a **0.013**
  within-arm spread.
- **Written up as preprint v2** (10 Aug), which carries all of the above and roughly doubles the
  paper — [DOI 10.5281/zenodo.21877316](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21877316), details under
  [Citing Soup](#citing-soup).

The full measurement record, published as written including the rejected hypotheses and the
false positives that controls caught, is
[`benchmarks/gate-h100-validation.md`](benchmarks/gate-h100-validation.md).

```yaml
# soup.yaml — then just `soup train --config soup.yaml`
training:
  stream_layers: true      # base streams out of VRAM; only the adapter trains
  quantization: 4bit       # NF4 — ~4x smaller store, so 8B fits a 4 GB card
  batch_size: 4            # bigger batches amortise the weight read
  stream_source: auto      # RAM when it fits, NVMe disk when it does not
  seed: 1234               # new in v0.73.0
```

> Python **3.10–3.12** only. v0.73.0 adds the upper bound that was missing: on 3.13+, pip
> used to resolve untested PyTorch wheels that crash in the native extension before Soup
> runs at all.

<details>
<summary>Previous release — v0.72.4, align on a laptop (DPO / ORPO / SimPO / KTO over layer streaming)</summary>

Layer streaming used to support supervised fine-tuning only; v0.72.4 opened it to the
preference losses. The risk was one thing: DPO needs a reference model, and a second copy
would double memory and defeat the point. Soup uses *the same streamed base with its
adapters switched off* — measured at **0.914×** the SFT peak, where forcing a real second
instance cost **+730 MB, exactly one copy of the weights**. Bit-exact against a normal
non-streamed run for all four. Honest cost: free in *memory*, not in *time* — DPO reads the
layer stack **1.52×** as often per step. `grpo` / `ppo` stay excluded on purpose.

> **Trained with `stream_layers: true` on v0.72.0?** That adapter is inert — its tensors were
> saved under keys with an extra `.inner.` segment, so every loader returned the untuned base.
> Fixed in v0.72.1; re-run or re-save. Check with:
> `python -c "from safetensors.torch import load_file; print([k for k in load_file('adapter_model.safetensors') if '.inner.' in k][:3])"`

<details>
<summary>Previous release — v0.71.40, soup reward synth (generate a reward verifier from your data)</summary>

Point `soup reward synth` at a JSONL of reference outputs and it infers a deterministic verifier,
writes a readable / committable `.py` reward function, and — the part nobody else does — *refuses* to
emit one that can't tell your references from bad answers (four families: `numeric` / `json_schema` /
`regex` / `tool_call`; a mandatory calibration report is the moat). Reward ensembles
(`reward_fn: "accuracy,format"`) also train now. (#311)

```bash
soup reward synth references.jsonl -o reward.py --output-report calib.json
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Previous release — v0.71.39, CI for weights not prompts (emit + provenance-bind the ship verdict)</summary>

`soup ship`'s verdict became emittable, committable, and provenance-bound: `--emit-evidence` makes a
run replay into an identical verdict, `eval.ship` in `soup.yaml` + `--config` makes the gate policy
reviewable, and `--config` binds evidence to the exact recipe that produced it (stale evidence → exit 3).
`soup ship --push owner/repo#N` posts the SHIP / DON'T-SHIP card on the PR.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Previous release — v0.71.38, The gate grows teeth (real leg-2 regression gate)</summary>

`soup ship`'s regression leg became real: a fixed, extraction-based scorer over seven bundled,
offline suites (MCQ · arithmetic · tool-calling · JSON validity · safety/refusal). A tune that
wins your task but quietly breaks tool-calling now gets a **DON'T SHIP**. Zero new deps.

```bash
soup ship --base ./base --adapter ./my-lora --task-eval my_task.jsonl
#   exit 0 = SHIP · 2 = DON'T SHIP · 3 = bad flags · 1 = runtime error
```

</details>

Full history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) &middot; [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/releases).

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Light core: CLI + config + data tools, no PyTorch
pip install soup-cli

# Add the training stack (torch, transformers, peft, trl, datasets, …)
pip install "soup-cli[train]"

# Everything (train + serve + ui + data) in one shot
pip install "soup-cli[all]"

# Or from GitHub (latest dev)
pip install git+https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup.git
```

The full extras table (`fast`, `mlx`, `serve`, `eval`, `ui`, `vision`, `audio`, …) lives in
[`docs/models.md`](docs/models.md#optional-extras).

> **Double quotes, not single.** `"soup-cli[train]"` is the only spelling that works in every
> shell — `cmd.exe`, PowerShell, bash and zsh. If you copied `'soup-cli[train]'` from an older
> tutorial and pip rejected it, that is the reason:
> [why, and the exact error](docs/models.md#quoting-the-extra).

`soup init`, `soup data …`, and the other data/inspection commands work on the light install.
Fine-tuning (`soup train`) needs the `[train]` extra.

### 2. Create a config

```bash
soup init                       # interactive wizard
soup init --template chat       # or start from a template
```

Templates: `chat`, `code`, `tool-calling`, `medical`, `reasoning`, `vision`, `kto`, `orpo`,
`simpo`, `ipo`, `bco`, `rlhf`, `pretrain`, `moe`, `longcontext`, `embedding`, `audio`.

### 3. Train, test, ship

```bash
soup train --config soup.yaml                 # LoRA, quantization, batching — all handled
soup chat  --model ./output                    # talk to your model
soup push  --model ./output --repo you/my-model

soup merge  --adapter ./output                              # merge LoRA into the base
soup export --model ./output --format gguf --quant q4_k_m   # GGUF for Ollama / llama.cpp
```

More export targets (ONNX, TensorRT, AWQ, GPTQ, BitNet) and deployment options live in
[`docs/serving-and-export.md`](docs/serving-and-export.md).

## Configuration

A complete `soup.yaml`:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: sft
# backend: unsloth  # 2-5x faster, pip install "soup-cli[fast]"

data:
  train: ./data/train.jsonl
  format: alpaca
  val_split: 0.1

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 2e-5
  batch_size: auto
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit

output: ./output
```

`config/schema.py` is the single source of truth for every field. Advanced data, training,
and PEFT options are documented under [Documentation](#documentation).

```

The complete command list is in [`docs/commands.md`](docs/commands.md).

## Supported Models

Soup works with **any** text-generation model on the
[HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation) — if it loads with
`AutoModelForCausalLM`, it works, zero config changes. Llama 3.x/4, Qwen 2.5/3, Gemma 3, Mistral,
Mixtral, DeepSeek R1/V3, Phi-4, and 100+ others ship as ready-made recipes (`soup recipes list`).

| VRAM | Max model (QLoRA 4-bit) | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 8 GB | ~7B | Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B |
| 16 GB | ~14B | Phi-4-14B, Qwen2.5-14B |
| 24 GB | ~34B | CodeLlama-34B, Yi-1.5-34B |
| 48 GB | ~70B | Llama-3.3-70B |
| 80 GB+ | 70B+ (full) or MoE | Mixtral-8x22B, DeepSeek-V3 |

Full model + vision tables and the optional-extras matrix are in [`docs/models.md`](docs/models.md).

## Docker

Run Soup without installing CUDA or PyTorch locally (image published to GHCR on every release):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/makazhanalpamys/soup:latest
docker run --gpus all -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/makazhanalpamys/soup train --config soup.yaml
docker compose up   # or build locally
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12 (those are the versions CI tests; 3.13+ is not supported yet
  because the PyTorch stack has not been validated there)
- GPU with CUDA (recommended), Apple Silicon (MPS), or CPU (experimental — very slow)
- 8 GB+ VRAM for 7B models with QLoRA

All training tasks run on CPU for testing (quantization auto-disabled). Optional extras
(`train`, `all`, `fast`, `vision`, `qat`, `serve`, `serve-fast`, `ui`, `eval`, `deepspeed`,
`liger`, `mlx`, `onnx`, `tensorrt`, …) are listed in
[`docs/models.md`](docs/models.md#optional-extras).

## Troubleshooting

```bash
soup doctor    # GPU, system resources, dependencies, and version in one place
```

- **`ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _C` (Windows)** — reinstall PyTorch for your
  CUDA version: `pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`.
- **`soup version` ≠ `pip show soup-cli`** — multiple Python installs; use a virtualenv.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup.git
cd Soup
pip install -e ".[dev]"

ruff check src/soup_cli/ tests/    # lint
pytest tests/ -v                   # unit tests (fast, no GPU)
pytest tests/ -m smoke -v          # smoke tests (downloads a tiny model, trains)

pre-commit install                 # optional: ruff lint+format on commit
```

## Support Soup

Soup is Apache-2.0 and free — and stays that way. It is built and maintained in the open on a
single 4 GB laptop, which is why every performance number in these docs is measured rather than
claimed.

If Soup saved you a training run, [starring the repo](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup)
helps most, and it costs nothing. If you would like to fund the work directly:

**[❤️ Donate](https://buy.stripe.com/4gMcN441k3pha3T19ye7m04)** — one-off, any amount (use
*Change amount* on the checkout page). Payments are processed by Stripe under the maintainer's
registered business, **MePlay, Inc.** — that name, not "Soup", is what appears on the checkout
page and on your card statement.

Donations buy GPU time for the hardware-gated work — multi-GPU, 8B+ validation, Apple Silicon —
that a single 4 GB laptop cannot reach.

The other way to move exactly those items is **hardware itself**. They ship behind honest
"requires \<hardware\>" gates rather than unverified claims, so if you have access to a bigger
box — or GPU credits going unused — running one of the
[`help wanted`](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
issues and posting the numbers helps as much as funding the GPU time would. Those issues say
exactly what is blocked on hardware today.

## Citing Soup

Layer streaming — training an 8B model on a 4 GB laptop GPU by streaming the frozen base from
host RAM one decoder layer at a time — is described in a preprint, together with the correctness
protocol that verifies a streamed run against a resident one (forward and backward stated
separately, because they are two claims and not one).

> Makazhan, A. (2026). *Exact Layer Streaming: LoRA Fine-Tuning of an 8B Model on a 4 GB Laptop
> GPU* (v2). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21877316

**Version 2 (10 August 2026) is current.** The title and the claim are unchanged — 8B on 4 GB —
and the paper roughly doubled, ~9,000 → ~19,800 words, to carry what the 8×H100 session produced:

- **Replication on hardware nothing like the original**: 119.6 tok/s on the RTX 3050 against a
  median 113.00 on an H100, at the same 3.32 GB peak. The method is bound by host-to-device
  transfer, not by the GPU.
- **A silent wrong-gradient defect, found and repaired.** On NF4 above ~165 MiB per layer the
  forward stayed bit-exact and the loss curve looked healthy while the gradients were wrong. The
  cause is named in the upstream library and reported there; the repair is gated against controls
  on real 32B and 72B.
- **Bit-exactness at real model sizes** instead of three-layer toys: forward from 0.5B to 72B,
  backward at 8B and 14B.
- **Trained-model quality, measured for the first time**, and indistinguishable from a resident run.
- **A comparison against DeepSpeed** — including the result that does not flatter us: eight cards
  of ZeRO-3 are slower than one card training resident.
- **The limitations section rewritten**: four of v1's closed, seven new ones added.
